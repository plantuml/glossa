# Wiki syntax converter

`Glossa` is an incubation library designed to parse and convert various wiki syntaxes, including Markdown, AsciiDoc, Creole, and more, through a centralized pivot format, Glossa Markup Language (GML).

This project is being developed with future integration into PlantUML in mind.

## Overview

Built on the GML pivot format, Wiki Syntax Converter provides a uniform intermediate representation that facilitates the translation between diverse markup languages. By standardizing conversion through GML, the library aims to simplify both documentation and diagram generation workflows, particularly with upcoming PlantUML integration.

## Features

- **Multi-Syntax Support:** Parse and convert common wiki syntaxes such as Markdown, AsciiDoc, Creole, etc.
- **Pivot Format (GML):** Leverages Glossa Markup Language as a universal intermediary for reliable and consistent conversion.


## Roadmap

- **GML Specification:** Finalize and document the Glossa Markup Language.
- **Extended Syntax Support:** Enhance parsing capabilities for additional wiki syntaxes.
